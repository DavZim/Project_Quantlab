# Project_Quantlab

A project that tries to introduce people to different concepts in econometrics, statistics, and quantitative analysis through an interactive design.

Currently the project gives a small introduction to stationarity and linear regressions. If you have ideas of how to expand the project, please feel free to contact me.

Feel free to fork the project.


# Installation

In order to run project quantlab, make sure you have the following packages installed: `shiny`, `shinydashboard`, `gridExtra`, `Cairo`, `ggplot2`, `data.table`, `markdown`, and `knitr`.
You can install all at the same time with `install.packages(c("shiny", "shinydashboard", "gridExtra", "Cairo", "ggplot2", "data.table", "markdown", "knitr"))` (if `Cairo` doesnt work, you can leave it out as well.).

Then you can run the app with `shiny::runGitHub("DavZim/Project_Quantlab")`.
